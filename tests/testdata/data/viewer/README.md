# GLTF 3D Model Viewer

⚠️ Currently supports `.glb` files only.

3D models with the `.glb` format are rendered in repository file view.

## 🔨 How to Test

1) Create a new repository or use an existing one.
2) Upload a `.glb` file such as [Unicode❤♻Test.glb](./Unicode❤♻Test.glb) (CC0 1.0 Universal).
3) View the file in the repository.
    - Similar to image files, the 3D model should be rendered in a viewer.
    - Use mouse clicks to turn and zoom.
