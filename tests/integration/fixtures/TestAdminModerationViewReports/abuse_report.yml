  remarks: Just because you are the administrator of this Forgejo instance this doesn't mean that you should be more privileged compared to the rest of average users. I believe it is my right to post links to external websites where users can find more about myself and my own work, even if they are professional services. I strongly believe you should reconsider your totalitarian behaviour. The users of this instance deserve better, more inclusive rules that should prevent abuses from administrators or mod.
