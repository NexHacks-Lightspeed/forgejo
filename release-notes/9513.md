fix!: Prevent forked `.profile` repositories from displaying profile content. When a user forked a repository named `.profile` without having created their own `.profile` repository, the content from the forked repository was unexpectedly displayed on their public profile page. This could lead to users' profiles displaying content they did not intentionally create for that purpose. Forked `.profile` repositories are now treated as standard repositories and do not populate the user's public profile page. Users who wish to use the content from a forked `.profile` repository can convert the fork to a regular repository in the "Danger Zone" section of Repository settings. This issue was particularly problematic on instances where users had repository creation limits (-1) and would inappropriately use forked `.profile` repositories to obtain profile customization.
