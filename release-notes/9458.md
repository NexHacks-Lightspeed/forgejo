Forgejo subcommands which only accept flag options would previously ignore any command-line arguments that were not flags and silently proceed to execute the command. This could lead to unexpected effects; for example, `--must-change-password false` is actually parsed as two arguments, `--must-change-password`, and `false`, where the `false` argument was ignored. In order to prevent misunderstandings where the user may have intended a supported argument format (`--must-change-password=false`), the presence of extra arguments that are not flags will now result in an error. Users of the Forgejo CLI who are relying on the previous behavior will find their commands are now resulting in errors.
